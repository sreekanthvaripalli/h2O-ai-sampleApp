#Getting Started with H2O Python
Setting Up Dependencies
As much as I wish I could say implementation is just as easy as throwing out another pip install command, itâ€™s a fair bit more involved than that.
To begin, head over to the H2O stable link(http://h2o-release.s3.amazonaws.com/h2o/rel-zipf/1/index.html), and download the zip file containing the most recent version. Follow the commands below to finish installing the package.

1. From your terminal, run:

    cd ~/Downloads
  
    unzip h2o-3.32.1.1.zip
  
    cd h2o-3.32.1.1
  
    java -jar h2o.jar
  
2. Point your browser to http://localhost:54321
